#       This is a basic configuration of governments, for now this is
#       pretty basic, and I'll have to come up with a way to make things
#       as configurable as possible.
#
#       id = unique id for this government
#       displayName = name shown to players
#       good_rate = the amount at which each same-good type multiplies revenue (TODO?

#       beaker_rate = science rate
#       hammer_rate = production rate
#       trommel_rate = quarry + trommel rate.
